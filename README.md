# Nervion

Nervion is the name given to a RAN emulator that implements a novel cloud-based architecture to perform large-scale evaluations of core networks. Nervion allows the emulation of any RAN architecture through a configuration file in which the user can specify the control-plane behaviour and data-plane traffic of every UE that is part of such RAN architecture. 

For more details about the architecture of Nervion, you will find useful the paper published at [MobiCom 21](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2021/index.html) titled: [*Nervion: A Cloud Native RAN Emulator for Scalable and Flexible Mobile Core Evaluation*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3447993.3483248).

# Nervion Powder profile

Nervion is currently accessible through the [Powder platform](https://powderwireless.net/). We have published a Powder profile in which Nervion can be deployed with six different core networks.
A complete how-to guide of Nervion in Powder can be found [here](/doc/powder.md).
